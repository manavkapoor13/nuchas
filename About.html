            <h3 class="section-title">Our Story</h3>
            <p>Nuchas was founded by a group of Argentinian expats who were homesick for the comforting, delicious empanadas they grew up with. Determined to share this beloved national dish, they set out to perfect their family recipes and introduce empanadas to the American market.</p>
            
            <h3 class="section-title">How Nuchas Started</h3>
            <p>It all began with a simple dream - to recreate the flavors and textures of the empanadas we grew up enjoying, with the same level of care and attention to detail that our abuelitas (grandmothers) poured into every batch. From a small food truck operation in New York City to a thriving nationwide brand, Nuchas has grown steadily over the past decade.</p>
            
            <h3 class="section-title">The Nuchas Brand Story</h3>
            <p>What started as a small food truck operation has grown into a beloved brand known for our commitment to quality and innovation. Today, Nuchas is synonymous with gourmet empanadas and handheld foods that blend traditional recipes with modern twists.</p>
            
            <h3 class="section-title">Nuchas Mission and Values</h3>
            <p>At Nuchas, our mission is to share the rich culinary heritage of Argentina through our handcrafted empanadas and savory pastries. We are committed to using only the finest ingredients and time-honored techniques to create unforgettable flavors.</p>
            
            <h3 class="section-title">What Makes Nuchas Empanadas Unique</h3>
